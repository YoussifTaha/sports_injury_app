## Introduction
Sports Injury is a mobile application designed to help physiotherapists manage their Sports Patients and for the patients to keep it up with their physiotherapist.
## Features

With detailed photos, physiotherapists can quickly access and organize necessary tools for treatments. This streamlined approach ensures therapists are well-prepared, enhancing efficiency and quality of care during patient sessions

- Add New Patient : The Add New Patient Screen streamlines patient intake for physiotherapists. Beginning with patient ID entry and basic information input, it progresses to examination details, including injury region and suspected injury selection. Integration of patient radiology follows, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. A call-to-action prompts creation of a treatment program, facilitating seamless progression in patient care.

- Patient View : The Patient View Screen offers a comprehensive view of the patient's healthcare journey. It includes their basic information and their Radiology Images if found, and their treatment plan.

- Common Injuries Regions : The Common Injuries Regions screen aids physiotherapists in diagnosing and treating common injuries.
